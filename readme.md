1. The .gitignore file contains the password configuration. Feel free to rename CITE/includes/db_connection.example.php to db_connection.php after cloning this repository.
2. I have not included any of the user-generated images from either builds. These can still be found on the production server.
3. This repository contains the current production code for FPMT. The developer code was distributed in a ZIP file, but since I don't recall the bugs and direction of it, I have not included it here.
